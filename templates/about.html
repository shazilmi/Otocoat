				Calculation of Course Outcome Attainment score is currently a cumbersome process, and our
					project aims to make it a simple and quick one. Once a teacher logs in to the website using
				their Rajagiri email id, they can choose the class and the evaluation method for which marks are
			to be entered. The details of the students of that class will be made available along with the current
		marks, if entered. Once the marks are input by the teacher, the course outcome attainment score is calculated
	and displayed. Total course outcome calculation is also available to display.

			There are four evaluation methods which contribute to the CO score calculation, which are:<br>
				Assignments<br>
				Internal marks<br>
				Endsem marks<br>
				Course feedback<br>
		</p>
		<p style=width:31%;float:left;padding-left:30;>
		Total course outcome score is calculated using the following formula:<br>
		CO score = 20% * indirect assessment + 80% * direct assessment<br>
		where indirect assessment includes course feedback and direct feedback includes 
		internal marks, assignment marks and endsem marks.
